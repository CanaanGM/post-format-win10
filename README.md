 - customized to my usage


this meant to automate what i normally do after a "clean" format of win 10.
some apps are installed via winget others need to be installed manually (visual studio) ;-;.

it has large room for improvements but they'll have to wait till i learn more ~!

after customizing the terminal maybe upload the profile folder and clone it via this . . .
